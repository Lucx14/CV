Junior software developer, working at Seedrs. After over 10 years working as a hedge fund analyst I decided to enroll at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp, where I learned fundamentals of software development, Test driven development and object oriented programming. After finishing the course I started work at Seeds as a software developer where I was able to develop my skills working in Ruby on Rails and React.js. Confident in my ability to quickly learn new languages and technologies and I am motivated by working in a supportive team with a collaborative attitude on projects where I can use the skills i've learned to solve problems, be creative and be an asset to a team.

During my time at Seedrs & Makers i have had exposure to the following technologies:

- **Languages** : HTML/CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Ruby
- **Frameworks** : React (redux/hooks), Node.js, Express, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Next.js
- **Testing frameworks** : Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Jest, Zombie, Capybara, Nightwatch, Cypress, Cucumber
- **Databases** : PostgreSQL, MongoDB, mySql
- **processes** : Pair programming, OOP, TDD, MVC, Agile, git/github, command line, webapp deployment/Heroku, Api development

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker
I come from an economic science background educationally and in my roles at GAM and Thames River Capital I analysed P&L figures as well as complex trade structures and cash and position reconciliations on a daily basis. I also took on projects to automate data uploads into our systems and was involved in large data migrations between different administrators which involved alot of data analysis and reconciliation.
#### Communication
During my time working in hedge fund operations I was a main point of contact for many different business entities. On a daily basis i would liase with our investment managers and traders, senior business managers, counterparty banks and administrators, so clear communication was critical and has helped me in my most recent role.
#### Good working under pressure
Im used to working in a pressurised environment and on the Makers course there was an additional level of pressure coming from having to learn new technologies and sometimes new languages at the same time as trying to meet a deadline. This was at times extremely challenging but my previous experience has taught me how to deal with pressure, manage my time and understand when im blocked or need to take some time out to research a problem or ask a collegue for help.
#### Fast learner
During the time on the course I frequently encountered new technologies and had to understand them and implement them in short spaces of time, and in my role at Seedrs, i have taken my foundations and build on them, learning on both the front end and backend platforms.
