## Lucien Najev

Im a Hedge fund operations analyst and after over 10 years working for a number of funds im looking for a fresh challenge. after some thought and having always been interested in code and technology ive decided to make a career change and am looking to become a software developer in London. This led me to enroll at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp, where im looking forward to learning the fundamentals of software development and hopefully get a job as a full stack junior developer.

confident in my ability to quickly learn new languages and technologies and very motivated by working in a team on projects where i can use the skills ive learned to solve problems, be creative and be an asset to a team.

my learning objectives as im about to start the 3 month course at Makers academy, i hope to get exposure and confidence working with the following technologies: Ruby, Rspec, TDD, pair programming, Rails, OOP, Javascript, jasmine, MVC, node.js, Angular.js, Agile development, RESTful APIs, and maybe if i have time study some c++ on the side
