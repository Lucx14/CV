## Lucien Najev

I am an energetic and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer, recently graduated from Makers Academy and looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend the skills ive learned. After over 10 years working as a hedge fund analyst im looking for a fresh challenge and a career change. After some thought and having always been interested in code and technology I decided to enroll at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp, where for the last few months I have learned fundamentals of software development by building projects in teams, in pairs and independently, using.

Confident in my ability to quickly learn new languages and technologies and very motivated by working in a team on projects where i can use the skills i've learned to solve problems, be creative and be an asset to a team. able not not only use what ive learened over the last few months but also leverage the skills ive used over the past 10 years as a professional in investment operations such as analytical thinking, problem solving, working under pressure.....

have had exposure to following technologies:
- **Languages** : HTLM/CSS, Javascript, Ruby
- **Frameworks** : React, Node.js, Express, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra
- **Testing frameworks** : Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Jest, Zombie, Capybara, Nightwatch, Cypress
- **Databases** : PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **processes** : Pair programming, OOP, TDD, MVC, Agile development, git/github, command line, webapp deployment/Heroku.



## Skills

#### Analytical thinker
In my role at GAM and Thames River Capital I analysed P&L figures as well as complex trade structures and cash and position reconciliations on a daily basis. I also took on projects to automate data uploads into our systems and was involved in large data migrations between different administrators which involved alot of data analysis and reconciliation.
#### Communication
During my time working in hedge fund operations i was a point of contact for many different business elements from a set of investment managers, senior business managers, counterpar banks and administrators, so clear communication was critical.
#### Good working under pressure
under pressure and delivering on deadlines...final projects as well as delivering daily in my previous job solving problems dealing quickly with issues
#### Fast learner
during the time on the course i frequently encountered new technologies and had to understand them and implement them in short spaces of time, example makersBnB where we decided to tackle learning a new stack in nodejs, express and mongoDB having never worked with them before and in a week, we managed to have a program that was interacting with a database and running an MVC structure with a few routes. In my previous career implementing a new technology or using a new testing or reconciliation tool was always very quick
#### Adaptable
can adapt to situations quickly....during the course adapting to working as teams using new processes such as agile which we had not done before
#### Enthusiastic
v enthusiastic to begin a new career which ive decided to do off my own back and finance myself 
#### Team player
