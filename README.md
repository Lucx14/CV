Software Developer looking to advance a growing tech career. After over 10 years working as an Operations Analyst in the fund management field I decided to enroll at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech), a developer bootcamp, where I learned fundamentals of Software Development, Test driven development and Object Oriented Programming. After finishing the course I started work at [Seeds](https://www.seedrs.com) as a software developer where I was able to develop my skills working in Ruby on Rails, typescript and React.js in a team of developers working within the Agile framework. After 2 years at Seedrs I decided to take some time out to reflect on the work I had done so far and also to learn some new technologies. I have been working on Python and Django for a few months and hope to use that in my next role. Confident in my ability to quickly learn new languages and technologies and I am motivated by working in a supportive team with a collaborative attitude on projects where I can use the skills i've learned to solve problems, be creative and be an asset to a team.

During my time at Seedrs, Makers and in my personal projects I have had exposure to the following technologies:

- **Languages** : Ruby, Javascript, Typescript, Python, SQL
- **Frameworks** : Ruby on Rails, React (redux/hooks), Next.js, Node.js, Express, Sinatra, Django, Flask
- **Testing frameworks** : Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Jest, Capybara, Cypress, Cucumber
- **Databases** : PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **processes** : Pair programming, OOP, TDD, Agile, Git/Github, Api development, Docker, AWS

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker

I come from an economic science background educationally and in my roles at GAM and Thames River Capital I analysed P&L figures as well as complex trade structures and cash and position reconciliations on a daily basis. At Seedrs I developed the skills I had learned at Makers and used those along with my existing experience of analysis to solve complex problems using code. I enjoy in my spare time using websites like Exercism or codewars to solve coding challenges, ill include links to my solutions repos below.

#### Communication

During my time working in hedge fund operations I was a main point of contact for many different business entities. On a daily basis I would liase with our investment managers and traders, senior business managers, counterparty banks and administrators, so clear communication was critical and has helped me in my most recent role. At Seedrs my team (4 developers, 1 designer and a project manager) worked within the Agile framework, using practices like stand ups each morning, 2 week sprints, sprint retros, sprint planning sessions, pair programming, code reviews. Good communication was a key factor in the success of our team.

#### Good working under pressure

Im used to working in a pressurised environment and at my last role there was pressure coming from having to learn new technologies and sometimes new languages at the same time as trying to meet a deadline. This was at times extremely challenging but my previous experience has taught me how to deal with pressure, manage my time and understand when im blocked or need to take some time out to research a problem or ask a collegue for help.

| [Blog clone](https://github.com/Lucx14/makoto-niijima)                         | A simple mvp of a Medium style blog built as a full stack Django app using Docker and challenging myself to get it deployed on AWS temporarily, it wasnt free so I took it down but there is a short demo available on the repo and its pretty easy to get the app going locally with Docker if you follow the instructions on the readme.                                                                                                                                                                             | Python, Django, Docker, Materialize, AWS |

I wanted to use this project to help me understand more about working with images in the backend api, and learning to submit images to the api using form data in the front end. It is very much a bare mvp with some basic functionality and so i decided not to publish it in this state but a short demo is added to the frontend repo. | React/Redux, Rails/RSpec                 |
